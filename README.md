Optimized XOR Maximization Algorithm: O(log l) Complexity
Overview:
This algorithm efficiently computes the maximum XOR value between any two numbers within the range [l, r] by reducing the time complexity from O(log r) to O(log l). The key insight behind this optimization is that we iterate over the binary representation of the smaller number (l), leveraging bitwise manipulation to calculate the XOR without having to iterate over the larger number’s bits.

The Core Idea:
Iterate Over the Smaller Number: The key to this optimization lies in iterating only over the binary representation of the smaller number (l). This is because the remaining bits of the larger number (r) will automatically result in a 1 when XORed with corresponding bits of l. By focusing on the smaller number, we reduce the number of iterations, achieving O(log l) complexity instead of the conventional O(log r).

Bitwise Comparison: At each iteration, we compare the corresponding bits of l and r. The strategy is as follows:

If the bits are different (i.e., one bit is 0 and the other is 1):

We can directly XOR these bits, as different bits yield a 1 in the XOR result, thus increasing the XOR value.

If the bits are the same (both 0 or both 1):

When both bits are 1, the idea is to flip the corresponding bit of the smaller number (l) to 0 in order to keep the range large while maximizing the XOR value.

If flipping the smaller bit would reduce the number beyond the range, we try flipping the corresponding bit of the larger number (r) to 1, if possible.

When both bits are 0, we attempt to flip the larger number’s bit to 1, and if that’s not feasible, we try to flip the smaller number’s bit to 1.

Changing Zero Bits in the Larger Number: The key observation here is that the remaining zero bits in the larger number can be flipped to 1 as long as the XOR operation can result in an increase. This ensures that the resulting XOR value becomes:

\text{Maximum XOR} = 2^{\text{number of bits in } r} - 2^{\text{number of bits in } l}

 
This is because flipping all the remaining bits of the larger number to 1 gives the maximum possible XOR value for that bit length difference.

Efficient Power Calculation: Since the final XOR result depends on the difference in bit lengths between l and r, the value of the maximum XOR is calculated using a fast power function. This allows for quick computation of the difference in powers of two, and the complexity of the power calculation is negligible since it is computed in constant time due to the use of an optimized pow function.

Ignoring Invalid Operations: If any bit operation (flip or change) leads to values outside the range [l, r], it is ignored. This ensures that the final XOR value remains valid within the given range.

Key Advantages:
Reduced Time Complexity: By iterating only over the smaller number (l), the complexity is reduced from O(log r) to O(log l), making the algorithm much more efficient, especially when l is significantly smaller than r.

Efficient Bitwise Manipulation: The approach efficiently uses bitwise operations to adjust bits only when necessary, ensuring minimal operations.

Optimized XOR Calculation: By leveraging the fast power calculation and only adjusting the larger number when necessary, the solution can compute the maximum XOR efficiently, without redundant operations.

Range Preservation: The algorithm ensures that any changes to l or r during the XOR maximization process respect the given range, ensuring the result remains valid.

How It Works:
Binary Representation: Convert l and r into their binary forms.

Iterate Over the Smaller Number: Compare bits of l and r bit by bit, adjusting as needed:

If the bits differ, XOR them.

If the bits are the same, flip bits of the smaller or larger number to maximize the XOR value, ensuring the result stays within the range.

Efficient Power Calculation: Calculate the maximum XOR using fast power calculations, ensuring optimal performance.

Return the Maximum XOR: Output the final XOR result, which is the largest value achievable within the range [l, r].
